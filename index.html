			<h1>Hi! I'm Christine</h1>
			<p>
			&amp; I'm just heading into my first year actually being paid to churn out lines of code! I graduated from UBC CS in 2012, where although I was aware that females were the minority in the software developer community and volunteered for the department's female outreach program girlsmarts, the reality never really sunk in - there was always at least five or more females in each of my classes. Then I started going to tech meetups...that awkward moment when you relaize you're the only female in the room...The GirlDev meetup group is definatly a breath of fresh air.

			<h2>Mentoring Groups</h2>
			I'd like to join the Ruby group. Lately I've been working through the ruby lessons on <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons">The Odin Project</a>, an open source curriculum for learning web development. I've had a <a href="https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/pull/25">pull request</a> merged to the curriculum with some of my project solutions, but it would be awesome to have someone review my code and let me know when I'm doing things sub-optimally. I also get stuck a lot, like yesterday when I spent most of the day hopping around stackoverflow and people's blogs trying to figure out if Ruby is pass-by-value or pass-by-reference. Seems it's pass-by-value, but the value is a reference?

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>
			Last year, I joined a hackathon and hacked up a Ruby on Rails app, the <a href="https://github.com/jeremygoh/pleased_app">PLEASED app</a> for a medical researcher to use in her study, with an amazing and enthusastic team. I was also a student dev on the <a href="https://github.com/ctcyu/Markus">Markus</a> open source project, a Rails online marking app. In both experiences, while I was able to contribute, I was limited by my novice knowledge of the Ruby language and of the Rails framework, I was not able to contribute as much as I had hoped to. With Rails, it's quick to look up a tutorial and get started with a twitter clone app really fast, but when working on a real codebase, it's easy to get lost. That's why I'm working through the Odin Project lessons to gain a deeper understanding of Ruby.

			<p>
			Currently I'm working on two mobile applications, <a href="http://agentsofnature.com">Agents of Nature</a> (an educational game for kids to play outdoors) and <a href="http://explore150.ca">Explore150</a> (an app for discovering Canadian natural, historical and cultural sites). We build the apps using a cross-platform C++ sdk, <a href="https://www.madewithmarmalade.com/">Marmalade</a> to target both iOS and Android with one C++ codebase. I'd really like to experiment with native Java Android apps, and with Apache Cordova to see how mobile apps are more commonly created. I've only gone through and created the most basic apps of each type, thus far.
